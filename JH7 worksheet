***************** Your Final Project  *********

JING URL demoing your Program.

Currently the program will not run because I am completely blocked from connecting to russet. I do not know why this is, but can do a jing if it is resolved.

Russet will not allow me to ssh in or to connect with jdbc while running my app locally. Also, I cannot load russet.wccnet.edu manager pages in a browser. 

URL to your website hosted on russet.wccnet.edu:8000


Any optional comments regarding this problem.

I bit off more than I could chew and had a to scrap a lot of my work. I'm very sorry for the tardiness of this project.
